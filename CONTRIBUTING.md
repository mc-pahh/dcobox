## DCO Sign Off

All commits must be signed off with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
This attests that you have the rights to submit your contribution under our project's license.

To sign off your commits:

1. Configure your Git client with your real name and email:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
2. Add the `-s` flag when committing:
```
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
Or add the sign-off manually with:
Signed-off-by: Your Name your.email@example.com
